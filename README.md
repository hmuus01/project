# project
This project aims at building a fraud detection service able to identify fraudulent online credit card transactions. 
This will be achieved by creating a machine learning (ML) model. 
This model will be transferred onto a web-service where the data of a transaction will be uploaded and the web-service will send a response back, on whether the transaction is classified as fraudulent or legitimate. 
The ML-based system will be trained using an existing Kaggle data set. To do so, the user will be able to select one of several alternative training algorithms implemented in the system. 
The same dataset will be used to test the model.
